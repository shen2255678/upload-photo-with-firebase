# upload-photo-with-firebase
This is one of many ways to create a photo upload service using Firebase and Android. I belive there is a lot of more improvement work to be done to handle errors in the server-side.

This repo contains both the Android app and the firebase sources, they are in two separaed folders.

The folders are:

App - This is the Android App
Server - Firebase
# test
```python
s = "Python 語法高亮"
print s
```
